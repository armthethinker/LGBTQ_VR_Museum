Protip to add paintings and plinths symmetrically to the museum.

If your object is a ProBuilder object of width .5
Place one at position X, the other at position (-X-0.5).
E.g. painting A at X = -10, painting B at X = 9.5

If your object is a Unity native shape (e.g. a cube) of width .5
Place one at position x, the other at position (-x-1)
E.g. painting A at x= -10.25, painting B at x = -9.25
